# CULT Beast Training Interface Microservice
The [cultbeast.org Chat Program](https://cultbeast.org) and the [CULT Beast Telegram Bot](https://t.me/cultmagazine_bot) can be seen as example clients of the [decentralized open source ai supporting the cultdao](https://github.com/cultfamily-on-github/decentralized-open-source-ai-supporting-the-cultdao). 

Such example clients might inspire and educate people on how to integrate, leverage, control and optimize the [CULT AI](https://github.com/cultfamily-on-github/decentralized-open-source-ai-supporting-the-cultdao) in any chat program they like - e.g. discord, slack etc. 

[cultbeast.org](https://cultbeast.org) also serves as a user interface to simplify the exploration and the training of the [CULT AI](https://github.com/cultfamily-on-github/decentralized-open-source-ai-supporting-the-cultdao).

The main goal of this endeavor is to ensure that people can invest their time into more valuable things than answering repetitive questions. [CULT AI](https://github.com/cultfamily-on-github/decentralized-open-source-ai-supporting-the-cultdao) clients like the [cultbeast.org Chat Program](https://cultbeast.org) and the [CULT Beast Telegram Bot](https://t.me/cultmagazine_bot) can do so 24/7   

In order to strengthen resilience, scalability and technological freedom for contributors, we foster the emergence of a microservices architecture. 

## Status
First Drafts & Idea Collection

## Frontend
When it comes to state of the art web programming frameworks [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is the framework [of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4) imo.    
The two main reasons for that choice - comparing svelte to angular, vue and react - are performance and simplicity.   
You might continuously improve the performance of this page utilizing [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).   
To speed up programming while ensuring beauty we utilize the [UI Kit Attractions](https://illright.github.io/attractions/?ref=madewithsvelte.com) - see also [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkD88ARvucM&t=492s).

If you use VS Code as IDE you might want to install the extension named "svelte for vs code".  

## Backend
When it comes to off-chain backends [Deno](https://deno.land) is the runtime environment of choice imo.    
Deno can be perceived as the successor of NodeJS imo.  
You might check the [Deno Main Repo](https://github.com/denoland/deno) and join the [Deno Community](https://discord.com/invite/deno).

### Start Locally
To start the backend server locally you might execute:  

```sh

./start-cultbeast.org-server.sh locally

```

### Start in Production
```sh

./start-cultbeast.org-server.sh productionmode

```
