# CULT Education Games Microservice

The [cultplayground.org](https://cultplayground.org) allows for coordinated community based micro acts acts of revolt.

Our power is massive when we collaborate. 

Let us play and learn together in playful creativity to free the world.

The games which can be found here might inspire people to inspire their friends to
invest in CULT & RVLT early.

Everyone is invited to support the emergence of manifold architectures of freedom by contributing to this repository.

Play 2 Earn is inspired by [Revolt 2 Earn](https://rumble.com/v1lf3yb-revolt-2-earn-in-100-seconds-michael-saylor-talks-about-revolt-2-earn.html?mref=1e5w3p&mc=4izal). 


In order to strengthen resilience, scalability and technological freedom for contributors, we establish a microservices architecture. 

## Status
First Drafts & Idea Collection

## Frontend
When it comes to state of the art web programming frameworks [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is the framework [of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4) imo.    
The two main reasons for that choice - comparing svelte to angular, vue and react - are performance and simplicity.   
You might continuously improve the performance of this page utilizing [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).   
To speed up programming while ensuring beauty we utilize the [UI Kit Attractions](https://illright.github.io/attractions/?ref=madewithsvelte.com) - see also [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkD88ARvucM&t=492s).

If you use VS Code as IDE you might want to install the extension named "svelte for vs code".  

## Backend
When it comes to off-chain backends [Deno](https://deno.land) is the runtime environment of choice imo.    
Deno can be perceived as the successor of NodeJS imo.  
You might check the [Deno Main Repo](https://github.com/denoland/deno) and join the [Deno Community](https://discord.com/invite/deno).

### Start Locally
To start the backend server locally you might execute:  

```sh
deno run --allow-read --allow-net --allow-write --allow-env backend/server.ts 8042
```

### Start in Production
```sh
pm2 start backend/server.ts --interpreter="deno" --interpreter-args="run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net" -- 443
```
